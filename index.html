        <h1>Statistics on helmet use:</h1>
        <p>In Norway, 13,000 cyclists are injured each year 
            - a third are children under 14. Ten percent of 
            bicycle injuries are head injuries, and one in 
            five bicycle injuries that are treated in hospital 
            are head injuries. <br> <br> is 10 times the risk of 
            getting a head injury in connection with a bicycle 
            accident if you don't wear a helmet. Among cyclists 
            who do not wear a helmet, eight out of ten suffer a 
            head injury in connection with cycling accidents. <br> <br>
            Figures from the Oslo Emergency Medical Service show 
            that it is head injuries and arm injuries that make 
            up over 65 per cent of injuries. Of the most serious 
            injuries, most injuries are to the knees and legs, followed 
            by head injuries. It is young men who are most often injured 
            on electric scooters. Of 286 injuries where the e-kick cyclists 
            suffered head injuries, only 4 used helmets.</p>
